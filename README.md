# Customer segmentation analysis by using RFM metrics algorithm
# Goal of the project
The purpose of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Bike Company. Customer segmentation is performed by developing a RFM Model. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 5 groups. The analysis will help in determining which customers segments should be targeted in order to enhance sales revenue for the company. A Sales Dashboard for Customer Segmentation is developed using Power BI and the data quality assessment and analysis is done using SQL.

In this stage of analysis the customer segmentation was done by developing an RFM Model. The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions.

In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 11 groups. The groups being : New customer, champions, promising, potential loyalist, loyal customer.
