# Customer segmentation analysis by using RFM metrics algorithm
# Goal of the project
The purpose of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Bike Company. Customer segmentation is performed by developing a RFM Model. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 5 groups. The analysis will help in determining which customers segments should be targeted in order to enhance sales revenue for the company. A Sales Dashboard for Customer Segmentation is developed using Power BI and the data quality assessment and analysis is done using SQL.

# 2. Customer Segmentation by RFM
In this stage of analysis the customer segmentation was done by developing an RFM Model. The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions.

In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 5 groups. The groups being : New customer, champions, promising, potential loyalist, loyal customer.
